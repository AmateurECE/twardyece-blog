In my day-to-day, I'm employed as a full-time software engineer in the medical
space. I design software for systems that will hopefully save or change
someone's life for the better.

Before and after work, and on the weekends, I play around with servers in my
homelab and write applications that enable me with pathways to greater
automation. Whenever possible, I like to contribute work to open-source
projects. I enjoy creating projects that have the potential to benefit the
greater software community, and this is the place where I write about all of
these things.
